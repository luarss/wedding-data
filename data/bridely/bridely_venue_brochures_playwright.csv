https://www.bridely.sg/venue-brochures/highfive/r/recHImSsUINgV5fjB,recHImSsUINgV5fjB,HIGHfive,brochure,,"Rated 5/5 for venue from 1 couples & 1 guests: ‚ÄúWe booked Highfive event space for our wedding after party (about 10months in advance) and it was generally a good experience with Highfive event space! We worked along with Ray, one of the owners of the space. As we planned our event such that we would transition from our banquet (ends at 4pm) to an after party at high five, we appreciated that highfive allows us to book the space from 5pm onwards (set up at 4.30pm) so there isn‚Äôt a big gap from our banquet. Most event space allow booking only at 6pm onwards, which isn‚Äôt ideal. The event space is also relatively flexible, allowing storage of alcohols and our stores in their storage room for a night to ease our load. Our guests like the event space on the actual day, with a good variation of games and activities (Nintendo switch, fooshball, pool, board games, darts, karaoke, and even a kids area for the young ones!) it‚Äôs very comprehensive and suitable for family setting with multiple needs. Strongly recommend this event space for whoever that wish to hold parties!‚Äù"

Shirley and her team were very accommodating to the various dietary needs that our guest had. Most importantly the food here is spectacular. Many of our guest shared that the food was so memorable. Con: just take note that the restaurant isn‚Äôt pillar-less and in fact there‚Äôs areas where guest cannot see the stage. The sound system was a little soft at certain areas. However, as we didn‚Äôt mind any of this, we felt that the dinner space provided nice segmented spaces for us to group tables up to have their own space. Thank you Shirley and the team for supporting and giving us and our guest a memorable experience.‚Äù"

Waiters/waitresses have certain standard and friendly. Only issue that I deducted one star is that they do not have nursing room at level 3 where the wedding is held. To make matter worse, the ground floor nursing room is under repair and not convenient to go fron 3rd floor down to 1st floor then walk a distance to the nursing room. It will be good if they can have handicap cum nursing room as visitors can also be in wheelchair. Thank you for reading my comment.‚Äù"
